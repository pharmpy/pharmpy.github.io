	abstract = {The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is widely used for variable selection in mixed effects models. However, its expression is unclear in typical situations of mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample size is not meaningful. We derive an appropriate BIC expression that is consistent with the random effect structure of the mixed effects model. We illustrate the behavior of the proposed criterion through a simulation experiment and a case study and we recommend its use as an alternative to various existing BIC versions that are implemented in available software.},

	doi = {10.1515/ijb-2019-0082},
	abstract = {We consider joint selection of fixed and random effects in general mixed-effects models. The interpretation of estimated mixed-effects models is challenging since changing the structure of one set of effects can lead to different choices of important covariates in the model. We propose a stepwise selection algorithm to perform simultaneous selection of the fixed and random effects. It is based on Bayesian Information criteria whose penalties are adapted to mixed-effects models. The proposed procedure performs model selection in both linear and nonlinear models. It should be used in the low-dimension setting where the number of ovariates and the number of random effects are moderate with respect to the total number of observations. The performance of the algorithm is assessed via a simulation study, which includes also a comparative study with alternatives when available in the literature. The use of the method is illustrated in the clinical study of an antibiotic agent kinetics.},

abstract = {Abstract The full random-effects model (FREM) is a method for determining covariate effects in mixed-effects models. Covariates are modeled as random variables, described by mean and variance. The method captures the covariate effects in estimated covariances between individual parameters and covariates. This approach is robust against issues that may cause reduced performance in methods based on estimating fixed effects (e.g., correlated covariates where the effects cannot be simultaneously identified in fixed-effects methods). FREM covariate parameterization and transformation of covariate data records can be used to alter the covariate-parameter relation. Four relations (linear, log-linear, exponential, and power) were implemented and shown to provide estimates equivalent to their fixed-effects counterparts. Comparisons between FREM and mathematically equivalent full fixed-effects models (FFEMs) were performed in original and simulated data, in the presence and absence of non-normally distributed and highly correlated covariates. These comparisons show that both FREM and FFEM perform well in the examined cases, with a slightly better estimation accuracy of parameter interindividual variability (IIV) in FREM. In addition, FREM offers the unique advantage of letting a single estimation simultaneously provide covariate effect coefficient estimates and IIV estimates for any subset of the examined covariates, including the effect of each covariate in isolation. Such subsets can be used to apply the model across data sources with different sets of available covariates, or to communicate covariate effects in a way that is not conditional on other covariates.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate if model-based post-processing of common diagnostics can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantitatively identify model misspecifications and rectifying actions. The main investigated diagnostic is conditional weighted residuals (CWRES). We have selected to showcase this principle with residual unexplained variability (RUV) models, where the new diagnostic tool is used to scan extended RUV models and assess in a fast and robust way whether, and what, extensions are expected to provide a superior description of data. The extended RUV models evaluated were autocorrelated errors, dynamic transform both sides, inter-individual variability on RUV, power error model, t-distributed errors, and time-varying error magnitude. The agreement in improvement in goodness-of-fit between implementing these extended RUV models on the original model and implementing these extended RUV models on CWRES was evaluated in real and simulated data examples. Real data exercise was applied to three other diagnostics: conditional weighted residuals with interaction (CWRESI), individual weighted residuals (IWRES), and normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE). CWRES modeling typically predicted (i) the nature of model misspecifications, (ii) the magnitude of the expected improvement in fit in terms of difference in objective function value (ΔOFV), and (iii) the parameter estimates associated with the model extension. Alternative metrics (CWRESI, IWRES, and NPDE) also provided valuable information, but with a lower predictive performance of ΔOFV compared to CWRES. This method is a fast and easily automated diagnostic tool for RUV model development/evaluation process; it is already implemented in the software package PsN.},
