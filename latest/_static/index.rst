==================
Welcome to Pharmpy
==================


Pharmpy is an open-source software package for pharmacometric modeling. It has functionality ranging from reading and
manipulating model files and datasets to full tools where subsequent results are collected and presented.

Features include:

* A **model abstraction** which splits a model into core components which Pharmpy understands and can manipulate:
  parameters, random variables, statements (including ODE system), dataset, and execution steps
* An **abstraction for modelfit results** which splits a parsed results into core components: e.g. OFV, parameter
  estimates, relative standard errors (RSEs), residuals, predictions
* **Functions for manipulation of models and datasets** in the modeling-module: e.g. change structural model, add
  time-after-dose column, deidentify dataset
* **Tools to aid model development** in the tools-module: execution of models within Python/R scripts, automatic
  development of models (e.g. AMD, IIVSearch, RUVSearch), comparison of estimation methods
* Support for **multiple estimation tools**: parse NONMEM models, execute NONMEM, nlmixr2, and rxODE2 models, run all
  Pharmpy tools with NONMEM and some with nlmixr2

Pharmpy can be used as a regular Python package, in R via the pharmr package, or via its built in command line
interface.

We encourage your contribution to the Pharmpy project! You can report issues and post suggestions of features via
GitHub issues (to `Pharmpy <https://github.com/pharmpy/pharmpy/issues>`_ or to
`pharmr <https://github.com/pharmpy/pharmr/issues>`_). If you want to contribute with code you can find more information
under :ref:`contribute`.

Pharmpy is maintained by the Uppsala University Pharmacometrics group and is an open-source project.
