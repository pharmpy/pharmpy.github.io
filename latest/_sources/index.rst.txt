Pharmpy is a library for pharmacometrics. It can be used as a regular Python package, in R via
reticulate or via its built-in command line interface. The API of Pharmpy is model agnostic and
the library is architectured to be able to handle different types of model and data formats (currently
only NONMEM is supported).

Current features include:

* Parsing of NONMEM model files
* Parsing of NONMEM result files
* Transformations of models (such as setting absorption rates, adding covariate effects etc.)
* Generating NONMEM code for modified models
* CLI supporting dataset filtering, resampling, anonymization, and viewing as well as model transformations

Pharmpy is developed by the Uppsala University Pharmacometrics group and is an open-source project.
