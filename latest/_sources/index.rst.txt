==================


Pharmpy is a library and a set of tools for pharmacometrics. It can be used as a regular Python package, in R using the
pharmr package or via its built-in command line interface. Current features include:

* General model abstraction for pharmacometric models
* Manipulation of models
* Extraction of model estimation results
* Manipulation of datasets
* Various calculations and evaluations
* Running models
* Running higher level workflows or tools
* Plugin system to support different model formats
* Parsing and updating NONMEM models
* Partial support for model conversion to nlmixr and rxode

We encourage your contribution to the Pharmpy project! You can report issues and post suggestions of features via
GitHub issues (to `Pharmpy <https://github.com/pharmpy/pharmpy/issues>`_ or to
`pharmr <https://github.com/pharmpy/pharmr/issues>`_). If you want to contribute with code you can find more information
